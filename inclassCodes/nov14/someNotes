*Any exam that enables silly mistakes is a bad exam*

Theory for written exam:

1. MCQ type questions (for code type question, what output will it give. This gives seg fault, why?)
2. non-MCQ stuff:
    - when is which data struture used? and when is it useful? not useful?
    - some puzzle kinda stuff
        - car park: everyone wanna park at the closest empty location. keep track of the empty locations, earliest available slot. Also track of where is the car parked (location) - every car has unique id. 

        ANS: Min-heap for empty locations. Extract min element
        Describe what you will do when a car wants to park, and when a car wants to leave.
        JUST DEFINE WHAT WE NEED TO DO CLEARLY.
