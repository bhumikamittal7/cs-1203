Linked List
An imp data structure

Arrays
int id[10]; => assign 10 spaces in the memory to id, each place is of int type
* ←> & (two symbols, kinda opposite to each other)
int x = 3; (integer located at an address)
&x : location of x in the memory (tells you the location of the variable)
*&x : will give back 3 (tells the value of the variable)
int *y; (here y is address) 
y = &x;
	return 0;

}
