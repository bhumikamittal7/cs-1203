1. insert sort with linked list
2. version of select sort
3. findAddressofMax code and select sort with it 
        - Write a function to find the address of the max element in an array
        - Write a function to find the address of the max element in a linked list
4. write a version of quick sort - array and linked list
5. Study markov chebyshev inequality (become a better human) and central limit theorem
6. write an array, make it a heap, extract the min, insert a new element, and then extract the min again

- binary search tree deletion (SUPER IMPORTANT)
- weird operation (paritial reverse and all) with linked list

#=================================================================================================================================

- find predecessor and successor of any element in the bst 
- write the code for AVL tree insertion and deletion and also check if the tree is balanced or not
- write the code for AVL tree left and right rotation

- makefile (rules based) -- today's pain, tomorrow's gain
- it allows us to automate the process of compiling and linking the code
- it is a file that contains a set of directives that specify how to compile and link a program
- helps in remembering the dependencies between the files
- multiple executabels and libraries can be created from a single makefile

- debugging (gdb) - gdb is a debugger that allows you to see what is going on "inside" another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed
- #include<assert.h> - assert(condition) - if condition is false, the program will terminate and print an error message. Otherwise works fine without printing useless stuff

#=================================================================================================================================
gdb commands - help , break, quit, list, next, step, finish, print, display
if you are doing something recurrsive, bt (backtrace) could be helpful

valgrind - a tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling
